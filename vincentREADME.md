# vincent-Projects
Config files for my GitHub profile.
I have been developing for quite a while in the past
however, I was able begin to push some of my projects up to the repository.
the repository reflects my works and projects during my web developement journey. 
the repository may not show many "greens" yet, i have had my projects saved on my local server.
