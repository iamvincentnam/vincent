# vincent-Projects
Config files for my GitHub profile.

this folders contains bits and lists of projects which i have either completed or perfected. 
judgging from the progress box which displays 'green' indicating how often a developer 
submits a prject here, It might be thought that I have not submited much  projects since the account was created. 
the fact is, I only learned about git as at when i posted my first project on this repository. 
most of my already made projects were either sitting in the local storage or were being deleted. 

Each file has its counterpart markup language or scripting language in another folder just one position upwards
the overall container housing them all is the name of this repository.
